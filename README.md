## Form3 Go Exam

### Developer

David Kotlirevsky

### Current Go Seniority

Just a beginner


### Development Steps

Main IDEA: learn from TDD how to solve the exercise
* Create a simple test
* Make it run 
* Refactor later.


Steps of developing
* Read Your definitions
* Check API documentations
* Start project with some basics folders
* Create some test to Know from where I can start
* Check all APIs requirements from postman ( Added postman file into project)
* Create a bunch of accounts and start for fetching one of them
  * Lear earn how to test / consume and validate it.  
  * Check Fail results with Postman to validate them with tests
* Work with create
* Work With delete
* Enhance code and refactor being based on tests working

 
Considerations
* Test are running locally and running against console
but I couldn't make it run ok through docker compose, I mean , they run but there is a memory 
issue that I can't solve. I think pairing with some who can explain me the error 
would help a lot.

## Test runing by console:
